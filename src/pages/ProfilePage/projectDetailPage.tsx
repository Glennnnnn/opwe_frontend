        </header>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Under the support of the Personal Wealth Middle Platform System, a marketing map system was designed and developed to enable customer managers to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interact with customers</li>
                <li>Record interaction history</li>
                <li>Compile and summarize customer interaction data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The primary challenge in the overall design lies in accommodating multiple business lines within the system, including consumer loans, credit loans, and small business loans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Core data queries and API calls include accessing basic data stored in the Personal Wealth Middle Platform System, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer and product information</li>
                <li>Upstream system APIs for identity verification and credit ratings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These functionalities are used across all business lines and were extracted into common services to reduce code redundancy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the system stores a large amount of CRM-delivered customer visit information from other channels. Given the substantial data volume and the differing categories of visit information accessed by various business lines, table partitioning was implemented during the design phase to enhance query efficiency. Since the requirements for visit functions differ significantly between business lines, each was custom-designed and developed accordingly.

      <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
      <h3>Requirement Analysis</h3>
      <p>
          Communicated and implemented business requirements across multiple business lines, including consumer loans, credit loans, small business loans, and agricultural business.
      </p>
      <h3>System Architecture Design</h3>
      <p>
          The project was developed based on Spring Cloud, with services registered within the Personal Wealth Middle Platform System to ensure seamless interaction.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>ShardingSphere was used for database partitioning.</li>
          <li>Zookeeper was utilized for distributed task scheduling to handle multi-server data reception and persistence.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Team Management</h3>
      <p>
          Expanded the initial team of 3 back-end developers and 1 front-end developer to a team of 18 members:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>11 back-end developers</li>
          <li>5 front-end developers</li>
          <li>1 product manager</li>
          <li>1 tester</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Project Iteration and Delivery</h3>
      <p>
          Over 12 months, completed 18 iterations. By August 2023, the project was fully developed, tested (functional and technical), and launched. Key highlights include:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Over 500 APIs were developed.</li>
          <li>The system supports a daily user base of tens of thousands post-launch.</li>
      </ul>
